## Introduction

What did the fox say. What did the fox say. What did the fox say. What
did the fox say. What did the fox say. What did the fox say. What did
the fox say. What did the fox say. What did the fox say @Fox2020.

## Data

```{r}

## Dependencies
library(tidyverse)
library(reactable) ## Interactive tables
library(highcharter) ## Interactive viz
library(sjPlot) ## Model sumamry
library(lme4) ## Mixed models

## Figure 1 Data
data_fig1 =  data.frame(
    stringsAsFactors = FALSE,
    name = c(
      "The Left",
      "Social Democratic Party",
      "Alliance 90/The Greens",
      "Free Democratic Party",
      "Christian Democratic Union",
      "Christian Social Union in Bavaria",
      "Alternative for Germany"
    ),
    count = c(69, 153, 67, 80, 200, 46, 94),
    col = c("#BE3075", "#EB001F", "#64A12D", "#FFED00",
            "#000000", "#008AC5", "#009EE0"
    ),
    abbrv = c("DIE LINKE", "SPD", "GR???NE", "FDP", "CDU", "CSU", "AfD")
  )

## Figure 2 Data
data(GNI2014, package = "treemap")
data_fig2 = GNI2014  


## Figure 3 Data
data("sleepstudy")
data("efc")
efc$cluster <- as.factor(efc$e15relat)
```

For this paper we will be using some dummy data. The libraries and data
simulation or imports are shown above.

## Methods

```{r}
m1 <- lmer(neg_c_7 ~ c160age + c161sex + e42dep + (1 | cluster), data = efc)
m2 <- lmer(Reaction ~ Days + (1 + Days | Subject), data = sleepstudy)
```

We fit the following model. We specificied age as What did the fox say.

$$
y = x_1\beta_1 + x_2\beta_2 + x_2^2\beta_3 + \varepsilon
$$ {#eq-model}

::: column-margin
We know from *the first fundamental theorem of calculus* that for $x$ in
$[a, b]$:

$$\frac{d}{dx}\left( \int_{a}^{x} f(u)\,du\right)=f(x).$$

## Foxes are not green

What did the fox say. What did the fox say. What did the fox say. What
did the fox say. What did the fox say. What did the fox say. What did

```{r}
#| label: fig-plot

    name = name,
    y = count,

## Foxes like maps

What did the fox say. What did the fox say. What did the fox say. What
did the fox say. What did the fox say. What did the fox say. What did
the fox say. What did the fox say. What did the fox say.

```{r}
#| label: fig-map
#| fig-cap: "Foxes realy like maps but are hard to find."


hcmap(
    "custom/world-robinson-lowres",
    data = GNI2014,
    name = "Gross national income per capita",
    value = "GNI",
    borderWidth = 0,
    nullColor = "#d3d3d3",
    joinBy = c("iso-a3", "iso3")
  ) |>
    hc_colorAxis(
      stops = color_stops(colors = viridisLite::inferno(10, begin = 0.1)),
      type = "logarithmic"
    )
```

## Model

```{r}
#| label: fig-mtcars
#| fig-cap: "MPG vs horsepower, colored by transmission."
#| column: margin
#| echo: false

library(ggplot2)
mtcars2 <- mtcars
mtcars2$am <- factor(
  mtcars$am, labels = c('automatic', 'manual')
)
ggplot(mtcars2, aes(hp, mpg, color = am)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(formula = y ~ x, method = "loess") +
  theme(legend.position = 'bottom')
```

What did the fox say. What did the fox say. What did the fox say. What
did the fox say. What did the fox say. What did the fox say. What did
the fox say. What did the fox say. What did the fox say.

```{r}
tab_model(m1, m2)
```

## Discussion

Foxes are cute @Sparkes2022 We also show this in @fig-plot. However our
modeling reports that tail length significantly affects cuteness. What
did the fox say. What did the fox say. What did the fox say. What did
the fox say. What did the fox say. What did the fox say. What did the
fox say. What did the fox say. What did the fox say.
